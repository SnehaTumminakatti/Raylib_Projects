# Raylib Grid Project

## Description
The Raylib Grid Project is an interactive application developed in C using the Raylib library. This project visualizes the possible moves of a knight on an 8x8 chessboard. When a user clicks on a particular grid cell, the application highlights all the potential positions the knight can move to from that cell, following the L-shaped movement pattern unique to knights in chess.

## Features
- **Interactive Grid**: Click on any cell to see the knight's possible moves.
- **Visual Feedback**: Highlights potential moves on the chessboard for easy visualization.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design, leveraging Raylibâ€™s graphical capabilities.

## Technologies Used
- **Raylib**: For rendering graphics and handling user input.
- **C**: The core programming language used to implement the logic and functionality.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Graphical Programming**: Gained experience in creating graphical applications using Raylib.
- **Chess Logic**: Implemented the movement logic of a knight in chess.
- **User Interaction**: Developed skills in handling user inputs and providing visual feedback.
- **Debugging**: Enhanced debugging skills while resolving issues related to graphics rendering and user interaction.
